# Univariate Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

This is a **Univariate Linear Regression** project where I implemented a model to predict house prices based on the area of the house. The project uses Python along with `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib` for calculations and visualization.

## About

- I implemented **gradient descent** from scratch to optimize the slope (`w`) and intercept (`b`) for the linear model.  
- The dataset contains house areas and their corresponding prices.  
- The code normalizes the data before training to ensure faster convergence.  
- After training, the model can predict the price of a house given its area and plot the regression line along with the predicted point.  

## Learning Reference

I implemented this project **on my own**, while taking **inspiration and reference** from **Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization** course.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Run the script

```bash
python HousePricePrediction.py

```
## How to Use
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the area of a house. After the calculation, a chart will be displayed showing the regression line along with your predicted house price.
